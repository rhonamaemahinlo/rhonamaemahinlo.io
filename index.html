                    Rhona Mae I. Mahinlo is my name, and I am 16 years old. I was born on the 30th of July 2007 in Baybay City, Leyte. 
                    My parents were Rodrigo Mahinlo Sr. and Majencia Mahinlo.  
                    My father is a deceased, he died almost a decade from now. My mother is a housewife.  
                    I have four brothers, Marlon, Marni, Melvin, and Rodrigo Jr. I also have a younger brother, Jerald. 
                    As you noticed I am the only girl or should I call it the “unica hija” of my parents. 
                    I’m a grade 11 student that took academic track in the strand of STEM at Hilongos National Vocational School (HNVS).</p>

                    There are a lot of things that I love and a few things that I hate. 
                    I love hanging out with my friends and going somewhere with them. 
                    Sometimes I prefer to stay at home and watches k-dramas or movies on Netflix with my family or me alone. I also love to 
                    draw or sketching people even though I'm still not good at it.
                    The things that I hate is being ignored, waiting, and lastly when someone’s minding others business or my business.

                    I am very motivated to create a miracle- that I, myself, couldn’t even imagine it, 
                    that I did it! and have worked hard to set that up, because I really believed a saying “miracle is a word of hard work!”, 
                    and I’m still looking forward in creating it someday.
